This project was made for internship in Innowise company
This application allows you to get data from the Github and Bitbucket Api and allows you to present this data in the form of a table with cells . By clicking on the cell, we can get additional data

Applications were mainly launched on the Iphone 14 pro simulator , so I advise you to run the same

Two buttons above the table allow you to select the search method (left button) and the sorting method (right button)
